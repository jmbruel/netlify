abstract = "Model-Based Systems Engineering plays a key role in managing the complexity in the development of modern cyber-physical systems. Model simulation allows conducting early validation and verification activities.  In  the  context  of  Extended  Enterprises,  systems  are  built  out of components developed in different companies as black boxes to protect the company Intellectual Property. Simulation activities then rely on co-simulation that combines the black box simulation of each component  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  whole  system.  Such  activities  are difficult  to  harness  as  the  simulation  results  depend  on  black  box  cosimulation frameworks that coordinate the simulations of each component. Our work targets the modeling of these simulations including the co-simulation framework in order to: a) make explicit all the simulation choices  and  have  a  better  understanding  of  the  simulation  results  and b) benefit from model-driven engineering facilities including automatic code generation. This contribution describes an early experiment based on the classical bouncing ball game example."
