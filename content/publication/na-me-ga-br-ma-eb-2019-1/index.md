abstract: "The considerable effort of writing requirements is only worthwhile if the\
  \ result meets two conditions: the requirements reflect stakeholders' needs, and\
  \ the implementation satisfies them. In usual approaches, the use of different notations\
  \ for requirements (often natural language) and implementations (a programming language)\
  \ makes both conditions elusive. AutoReq, presented in this article, takes a different\
  \ approach to both the writing of requirements and their verification. Applying\
  \ the approach to a well-documented example, a landing gear system, allowed for\
  \ a mechanical proof of consistency and uncovered an error in a published discussion\
  \ of the problem."
