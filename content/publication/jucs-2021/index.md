abstract: At the heart of cyber-physical and ambient systems, the user should permanently
  benefit from applications adapted to the situation and her/his needs. To do this,
  she/he must be able to configure her/his software environment and be supported as
  much as possible in that task. To this end, an intelligent &ldquo;engine&rdquo;
  assembles software components that are present in the ambient environment at the
  time and makes unanticipated applications emerge. The problem is to put the user
  &ldquo;in the loop&rdquo;, i.e., provide adapted and intelligible descriptions of
  the emerging applications, and present them so that the user can accept, modify
  or reject them. Besides, user feedback must be collected to feed the engine&rsquo;s
  learning process. Our approach relies on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). However,
  differently from the regular use of MDE tools and techniques by engineers to develop
  software and generate code, our focus is on end-users. Models of component assemblies
  are represented and made editable for them. Based on a metamodel that supports modeling
  and de- scription of component-based applications, a user interface provides multi-faceted
  representations of the emerging applications and captures user feedback. Our solution
  relies on several domain- specific languages and a transformation process, based
  on the established MDE tools (Gemoc studio, Eclipse Modeling Framework, EcoreTools,
  Sirius, Acceleo). It works in conjunction with the intelligent engine that builds
  the emerging applications and to which it provides learning data.
