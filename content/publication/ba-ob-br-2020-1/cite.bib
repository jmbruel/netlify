 abstract = {This paper presents the results achieved while pursuing the verification and validation of a train system behavior at the first steps of development in an industrial context. At this stage, and at least from the industrial point of view, the train can be considered as a System of Systems (SoS). A method is proposed, supported by preliminary results through the definition and verification of constrained states and preconditions to use cases, as well as a structure for the behavior.},
