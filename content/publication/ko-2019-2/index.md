abstract: Ambient environments consist of components surrounding the user and offering
  services. Applications can here be composed opportunistically and automatically
  by an intelligent system that puts together available components. Thus, applications
  that are a priori unknown emerge from the environment. The problem is in the intelligible
  presentation to an average user of those emerging composite applications. Our approach
  consists in automatic generation of user-oriented application descriptions from
  unit descriptions of each component and service. For that, we propose a well-defined
  language for component description and a method for combining descriptions. A prototype
  has been developed and used to experiment the generation of different composite
  application descriptions. Based on these experiments, we assess the degree of fulfillment
  of the requirements we have identified for the problem.
