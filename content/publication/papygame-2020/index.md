abstract: Gamification refers to the exploitation of gaming mechanisms for serious
  purposes, like learning hard-to-train skills such as modeling.We present a gamified
  version of Papyrus, the well-known open source modeling tool. Instructors can use
  it to easily create new modeling games (including the tasks, solutions, levels,
  rewards...) to help students learning any specific modeling aspect.The evaluation
  of the game components is delegated to the GDF gamification framework that bidirectionally
  communicates with the Papyrus core via API calls. Our gamified Papyrus includes
  as well a game dashboard component implemented with HTML/CSS/Javascript and displayed
  thanks to the integration of a web browser embedded in an Eclipse view.
