abstract = "The objective of this poster paper is to investigate on how to deal with environmental uncertainty in goal based requirements engineering. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems while SysMLKaos is a Goal based Requirements Engineering approach. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach."
