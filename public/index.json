MLOps movement adopts the DevOps objective of reducing the gaps between development and operations teams by integrating data scientist teams and Machine Learning (ML) models. In this project, we wish to apply and adapt good software engineering practices to strengthen both the overall quality of the ML model construction processes and the quality of the software systems produced, particularly in terms of extra-functional properties that will become crucial issues: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Security (FATES). The key concerns will tackle the study, formalization, measurement, and management of these properties throughout the continuous MLOps process. Indeed, more than traditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as precision and recall, are required to evaluate models' robustness in practical applications. Our project aims to study the FATES properties and, by refining proven software engineering concepts and tools, propose a systematic and tailored approach for considering those properties, particularly from the lens of ML Scientists or ML Engineers, throughout the lifecycle of the software developed following an MLOps approach.","tags":["AI","Requirements","DevOps"],"title":"FATES-MLOps","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1713358800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713341085,"objectID":"84af1f5a36a2b6eac1e5ea4e32974d19","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/20240417-innopolis/","publishdate":"2024-02-12T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20240417-innopolis/","section":"talk","summary":"Overview of the PEGS approach, from Bertrand Meyer, towards Requirements and Business Analysis.","tags":["Teaching"],"title":"PEGS Approach Overview","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1711904400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713342872,"objectID":"daa719dc635b42cc2c6a4c7645a2a5ce","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/20240329-scalability/","publishdate":"2024-02-12T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20240329-scalability/","section":"talk","summary":"Scalability issues in large systems requirements.","tags":["Research"],"title":"Requirements: Scalability Issues","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1708524000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707759235,"objectID":"13259513dc28e63083036150cc12a39e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/20240221-ai-workshop/","publishdate":"2024-02-12T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20240221-ai-workshop/","section":"talk","summary":"Although recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, there remain inherent challenges that hinder their widespread adoption in critical systems development and operation.

major determinant of the quality of software systems is the quality of their requirements, which should be both understandable and precise. Most requirements are written in natural language, which is good for understandability but lacks precision.To make requirements precise, researchers have for years advocated the use of mathematics-based notations and methods, known as “formal.” Many exist, differing in their style, scope, and applicability. The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them to informal methods.The analysis uses a set of nine complementary criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, and traceability support. It classifies the approaches into five categories based on their principal style for specifying requirements: natural-language, semi-formal, automata/graphs, mathematical, and seamless (programming-language-based). It includes examples from all of these categories, altogether 21 different approaches, including for example SysML, Relax, Eiffel, Event-B, and Alloy.The review discusses a number of open questions, including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.","tags":["\"Formal\"","\"specification\"","\"software\"","\"requirement\"","\"seamless\""],"title":"The Role of Formalism in System Requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamna Aslam","Alexandr Naumchev","Jean-Michel Bruel","Joseph Alexander Brown"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665561768,"objectID":"2ecafd61eef56b57fe3ee5735936d340","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/dblp-confisdevel-aslam-nbb-21/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T07:58:52.369262Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confisdevel-aslam-nbb-21/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Examining Requirements Documentation through the Focused Conversation Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvie Trouilhet","Jean-Paul Arcangeli","Jean-Michel Bruel","Maroun Koussaifi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627458314,"objectID":"d07e9528d9e042106e3fb2ee6d1dfcb4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jucs-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-28T07:40:39.104474Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jucs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"At the heart of cyber-physical and ambient systems, the user should permanently benefit from applications adapted to the situation and her/his needs. To do this, she/he must be able to configure her/his software environment and be supported as much as possible in that task. To this end, an intelligent \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo; assembles software components that are present in the ambient environment at the time and makes unanticipated applications emerge. The problem is to put the user \u0026ldquo;in the loop\u0026rdquo;, i.e., provide adapted and intelligible descriptions of the emerging applications, and present them so that the user can accept, modify or reject them. Besides, user feedback must be collected to feed the engine\u0026rsquo;s learning process. Our approach relies on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). However, differently from the regular use of MDE tools and techniques by engineers to develop software and generate code, our focus is on end-users. Models of component assemblies are represented and made editable for them. Based on a metamodel that supports modeling and de- scription of component-based applications, a user interface provides multi-faceted representations of the emerging applications and captures user feedback. Our solution relies on several domain- specific languages and a transformation process, based on the established MDE tools (Gemoc studio, Eclipse Modeling Framework, EcoreTools, Sirius, Acceleo). It works in conjunction with the intelligent engine that builds the emerging applications and to which it provides learning data.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Driven Engineering for End-Users in the Loop in Smart Ambient Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607684400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607096590,"objectID":"ea720bfcbdd3b7b1f9d068a059933c6e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/20201204-cusi/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20201204-cusi/","section":"talk","summary":"Retours sur les impacts de la COVID'19 en termes d'enseignements dans le supérieur","tags":["Teaching"],"title":"Le Monde d’après 2020","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665587703,"objectID":"c649b2850663477f8e1ae42e3b5dfb7b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/airbus/","publishdate":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/airbus/","section":"project","summary":"Despite the success of Model-Based Systems Engineering adoption, its application at scale and in a continuous approach to ensure the delivery of added value for its adopters is far from straightforward.

Applications can here be composed opportunistically and automatically by an intelligent system that puts together available components.

Our approach consists in automatic generation of user-oriented application descriptions from unit descriptions of each component and service. For that, we propose a well-defined language for component description and a method for combining descriptions. A prototype has been developed and used to experiment the generation of different composite application descriptions.

This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering.

RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that include explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements.

Model simulation allows conducting early validation and verification activities.

Such  activities  are difficult  to  harness  as  the  simulation  results  depend  on  black  box  cosimulation frameworks that coordinate the simulations of each component.
